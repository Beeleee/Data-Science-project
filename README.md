### 1. Python Data-science Introduction- Web Scrapping
Web scraping (also called web data extraction or data scraping) provides a solution for those who want to get access to structured web data in an automated fashion. 
Web scraping is useful if the public website you want to get data from doesn't have an API, or it does but provides only limited access to the data.
Hence:-
- I scrapped data from the Zimbabwe Stock Exchang
- Scrapped Emails from the same
- Scrapped images from the same website
- Scrapped tables from the World population Wikipedia webpage and converted it into a dataframe.
- Used pandas (pd.read.html) to scrap data from a table @'https://www.zse.co.zw/price-sheet' website.
- Cleaned the data although it had a lot of discrepencies 
- Saved the new data set into my local library [Blessing Nehohwa]

### 2. Introduction to Data Analysis project
This analyis is based on the King County Seattle House Sales Its a dataset of homes sold between May 2014 - May 2015
It shows all introductory steps to analysisng a data set [Blessing Nehohwa]

### 3. USA Unemployment spatial data analysis
Among the most commonly used charts in geographic data is the geostatistical map. It is a form of graphic in because we use color to depict facts of an identifying characteristic in relation to its place â€” for example, the labor participation rate in each region.
August 2022 data
The analysis from the current unemployment data in the United states ranking state by state from the one with lowest to highest.
We realised that Minessota is the state with the lowest level of unemployment of 1.9 % and New York city with hight rate of unemepolyment of 5.1% siting on the 50th position.
I then plotted a choropleth map showing different states and colours showing different Unemployment rate percentages. [Blessing Nehohwa]

### 4.SAT/GPA Simple Linear Regression Analysis
SAT scores have long been a major factor in college admissions, under the assumption that students with higher test scores will perform better in college and receive a higher GPA. We can see that the SAT is a good indicator of the GPA of an student after graduation, but we can see that out R^2 is a bit lower, so we may need more variables to perform a better regression.

### 5. Logistic Regression Model to show the relationship between students SAT scores and them being Admitted [yes,No]
Assumptions of this regression model Linearity,No outliers, independence,No endogeneity,No auto correlation,No multi-collinearity and Normality and homoscedasticity Logistic regression is senstive to outliers ,the data should not contain any outlier This logistic curve can be interpreted as the probability associated with each outcome across independent variable values. Logistic regression assumes that the relationship between the natural log of these probabilities (when expressed as odds) and your predictor variable is linear. Each data observation (data points)should be independent ,this means no value depends on each other [Blessing Nehohwa].

### 6. Canada Migration Analysis (1980-2014)
A Choropleth map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map, such as population density or per-capita income. Choropleth map provides an easy way to visualize how a measurement varies across a geographic area, or it shows the level of variability within a region.These are very critical in GIS or Spatial Data Analysis. In this Analysis am using the Canadian immigration dataset so as to ascertain which countries contributed most number immigrants into canada for the period from 1980 to 2013. The details to be visualised in a choropleth. [Blessing Nehohwa]


### 7. Crime Incidents of San Francisco

This analysis is showing how to use folium ,to draw map and use markers to show the number of different Crime incidents commited in different areas around San Francisco in 2016. Using the San Franscico Police department incidents dataset 2016.[Blessing Nehohwa]

### 8. Zimbabwean Map using Folium

This lab heavily relies on pandas and Numpy for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization. The primary plotting library we will explore in this lab is Folium.
Folium is a powerful Python library that helps you create several types of Leaflet maps. 
- The fact that the Folium results are interactive makes this library very useful for dashboard building.
- Folium builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the mapping strengths of the Leaflet.js library. Manipulate your data in Python, then  
  visualize it in on a Leaflet map via Folium.
- Folium makes it easy to visualize data that's been manipulated in Python on an interactive Leaflet map. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth 
  visualizations as well as passing Vincent/Vega visualizations as markers on the map.
