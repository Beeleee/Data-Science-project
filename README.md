### 1. USA Unemployment spatial data analysis
Among the most commonly used charts in geographic data is the geostatistical map. It is a form of graphic in because we use color to depict facts of an identifying characteristic in relation to its place â€” for example, the labor participation rate in each region.
August 2022 data
The analysis from the current unemployment data in the United states ranking state by state from the one with lowest to highest.
We realised that Minessota is the state with the lowest level of unemployment of 1.9 % and New York city with hight rate of unemepolyment of 5.1% siting on the 50th position.
I then plotted a choropleth map showing different states and colours showing different Unemployment rate percentages. [Blessing Nehohwa]

### 3. Logistic Regression Model to show the relationship between students SAT scores and them being Admitted [yes,No]
Assumptions of this regression model Linearity,No outliers, independence,No endogeneity,No auto correlation,No multi-collinearity and Normality and homoscedasticity Logistic regression is senstive to outliers ,the data should not contain any outlier This logistic curve can be interpreted as the probability associated with each outcome across independent variable values. Logistic regression assumes that the relationship between the natural log of these probabilities (when expressed as odds) and your predictor variable is linear. Each data observation (data points)should be independent ,this means no value depends on each other [Blessing Nehohwa].
